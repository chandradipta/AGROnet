🌾 AGROnet – Smart Agriculture & Supply Chain Platform

AGROnet is a modern, web-based agricultural management and supply chain platform built to support farmers, growers, logistics providers, and buyers across the entire agri-ecosystem. Designed with scalability and user-friendliness in mind, AGROnet facilitates seamless interaction, transparency, and traceability in agricultural operations.

This multi-page application is built entirely using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and represents a static prototype of a full-scale digital agriculture solution. It includes dedicated sections for farmers, crop monitoring, food & beverage logistics, orchard management, dairy farms, and more.

💡 Purpose
AGROnet is intended as a front-end demo or conceptual prototype for developers, startups, or researchers working in AgriTech. It serves as a design mockup that can be extended into a dynamic platform using backend integrations, database support, APIs for crop/weather analytics, and IoT integrations.

🚀 Future Scope
Real-time data analytics for crop yield and supply forecasting.

Integration with agri-market APIs for live pricing.

Authentication, user dashboards, and order tracking.

Mobile responsiveness and progressive web app (PWA) upgrades.
