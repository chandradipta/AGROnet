# 🌾 AGROnet – Smart Agriculture & Supply Chain Platform

**AGROnet** is a modern, web-based agricultural management and supply chain platform designed to support stakeholders across the agricultural ecosystem — including farmers, growers, logistics providers, and buyers. Built with scalability and user-centric design in mind, AGROnet enables seamless interaction, transparency, and traceability throughout agricultural operations.

This multi-page static web application is developed entirely using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript**. It serves as a prototype for a full-scale AgriTech solution and includes dedicated pages for various stakeholders and functions such as crop monitoring, dairy farm tracking, logistics, orchard management, community learning, and more.
